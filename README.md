# ProjectOne
This is our project one, a webapp titled "BORED."

##What the project does
BORED allows the user to input their zipcode. From there the app will check the weather and local events. Using brilliant algorithms that correlate the weather and events, the user is then given a suggested list of activites to alleviate boredom.

##Why the project is useful
Research is hard.  The internet is complicated.  Decision fatigue is a real thing. BORED removes friction related with these effects and presents the user with an awesome activity to do.

##How users can get started with the project
To get started  head to https://brianchristopher.github.io/ProjectOne/ and click on the "I'm bored."

##Where users can get help with your project
You might want to ask a friend or loved one to help you press the button. Things are more fun when done together.

##Who maintains and contributes to the project
This project is an effort by Cracked Cheeseburger productions, a coding boot camp team formed specifically for this project to teach us how to work as a team.
